# Project-2
Introduction

This project introduces students to key object-oriented programming concepts, including interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, modularity, encapsulation, sub-typing, and overloading. The goal is to create a Quadtree data structure in Java.

Students are expected to apply computer science project management techniques and submit their code for grading. This is an individual project, and duplicate code will be penalized. Any submission with significant plagiarism will receive a grade of 0.


Operations to Implement:
You must implement the following operations for the Quadtree:

Insert Rectangle: Add a rectangle to the Quadtree.
Delete Rectangle: Remove a rectangle from the Quadtree.
Find Rectangle: Locate a rectangle in the Quadtree.
Dump Tree: Print the structure of the Quadtree.
Update Rectangle: Modify the length and width of a rectangle.


How to Run the Program

To execute the program, use the following command in your terminal:
java -cp target/classes quadtree.Main commands.cmmd
